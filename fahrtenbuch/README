fahrtenbuch collects solutions to read a driver's logfile that has the
following structure

.fahrtenbuch.txt
----
count	from				to			distance	reason
2		Berlin				Potsdam		30			training
2		Frankfurt (Main)	Paris		575			Linux event
1		Berlin				Hamburg		280			training
----

The scripts can be called like that:

----
$ cat fahrtenbuch.txt | /usr/bin/tclsh distanz.tcl
----

As a result, the total distance is printed. The following versions are
included:

* distanz.tcl: original version
* distanz.ub-fho.tcl: improved version by Uwe Berger and Frank Hofmann
